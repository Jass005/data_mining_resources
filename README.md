## Use cases 
### Business
- Kaggle, Data Science Use cases. An outline of business applications. Few companies have the data to implement these things. https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/DataScienceUseCases
- Kaggle, Competitions. (Make sure you chose “All Competitions” and then “Completed”.) Each competition has a leaderboard. When users publish their solutions on GitHub, you can find links to these solutions on the leaderboard. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions
Industrial solutions are more powerful and complex than these examples, but they are not publicly available. Data-driven companies post some details about this work in their blogs.

### Emerging applications
- Stanford’s CS229 Course, Student projects. See “Recent years’ projects.” Hundreds of short papers. http://cs229.stanford.edu/
- CMU ML Department, Student projects. More advanced problems, compared to CS229. http://www.ml.cmu.edu/research/data-analysis-projects.html
- arXiv, Machine Learning. Drafts of important papers appear here first. Then they got published in journals. http://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent
- CS departments. For example: CMU ML Department, PhD dissertations. http://www.ml.cmu.edu/research/phd-dissertations.html

### Government
1. Bloomberg and Flowers, “NYC Analytics.” NYC Mayor’s Office of Data Analysis describes their data management system and improvements in operations. http://www.nyc.gov/html/analytics/downloads/pdf/annual_report_2013.pdf
2. UK Government, Tax Agent Segmentation. https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/396175/Report348.pdf
3. Data.gov, Applications. Some are ML-based. http://www.data.gov/applications
4. StackExchange, Applications. http://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/3346/examples-of-useful-applications-that-are-being-developed-using-open-data
